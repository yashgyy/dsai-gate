## <a name="course"></a>NPTEL and MOOCs Courses

Course to deepen your knowledge of Probability and Statistics:

- **[Probability for Computer Science, IIT Kanpur](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106104233)**
   by Prof. Nitin Saxena IIT K,This is a crash course to introduce the concept of probability formally; and exhibit its applications in computer science, combinatorics, and algorithms. **Excellent Assignments with MCQs**
  
- **[Stat110 (Probability)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo)**
   taught at Harvard University by Joe Blitzstein: Lecture videos, review materials, and over 250 practice problems with detailed solutions are provided. This course is an introduction to probability as a language and set of tools for understanding statistics, science, risk, and randomness.

- **[Statistics and Probability | Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)**
The course looks vast, but upon deeper inspection, it seems like a mashup of undergraduate probability, including random variables and statistics. The probability portion is very similar to the engineering mathematics syllabus of the gate; the statistics part is a bit of addition that needs to be studied and contains primarily hypothesis testing.
